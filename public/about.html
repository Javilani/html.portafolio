<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a 29 years old Chilean recently graduated environmental engineer. I started learning about web development looking to expand my knowledge and in this way be able to look for other job opportunities.</p>
<p>As soon as I came across this area I fell in love with it, since then I continue to learn new things every day with the hope of being able to perform in this area one day.</p>
